# API Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a **document and folder management system** based on URLs. It allows users to create dynamic URLs to store and manage files securely. Only the user who created a file or folder can access and manage them, ensuring privacy through **JWT authentication** and robust security validations.

### Example:
A folder such as `documents/reviews` can store multiple files that can be accessed and managed at any time. When uploading a file with the same name, the system automatically assigns a version number to maintain a **file versioning system**.

For instance:
```
review.pdf
review_v1.pdf
review_v2.pdf
```
This ensures previous versions of a file are retained and accessible.

## Project Setup and Initialization

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js (Latest LTS Version)**
- **pip (Python Package Manager)**
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Start the Backend Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
   
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server using Uvicorn:
   
   ```sh
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### 2. Start the Frontend Server

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### 3. Access the Application

Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and navigate to:

ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Important Notes

- Both the **backend** and **frontend** must be running simultaneously for the system to function properly.
- If you encounter any errors, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that the ports are not in use.

# Unit Tests

To test the project using unit tests, you need to be inside the `backend` folder. Use the following command:

```sh
cd backend
```

You can run the tests individually or all at once. Below are the commands to execute the tests:

## Running Tests

### Folder and File Tests  
To test folders and files, run the following command:
**Windows Powershell**
```sh
$env:PYTHONPATH = "./"; pytest app/tests/test_folders
```

**Ubuntu/Linux(or WSL)**
```sh
PYTHONPATH=./ pytest app/tests/test_folders
```

### User Tests  
To test user-related functionality, run the following command:

**Windows Powershell**
```sh
$env:PYTHONPATH = "./"; pytest app/tests/test_users
```

**Ubuntu/Linux(or WSL)**
```sh
PYTHONPATH=./ pytest app/tests/test_users
```

### Running All Tests  
To run all tests at once, use the following command:

**Windows Powershell**
```sh
$env:PYTHONPATH = "./"; pytest app/tests
```

**Ubuntu/Linux(or WSL)**
```sh
PYTHONPATH=./ pytest app/tests
```

## Notes  

- **Individual Tests**: You can run specific test files or test functions by specifying the path. Example:

**Windows Powershell**  
  ```sh
 $env:PYTHONPATH = "./"; pytest app/tests/test_folders/test_create_folder.py::test_create_folder
  ```  

**Ubuntu/Linux(or WSL)**
```sh
PYTHONPATH=./ pytest app/tests/test_folders/test_create_folder.py::test_create_folder
```
  
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed to measure test coverage if required.  
- **Environment Variables**: The `PYTHONPATH=./` ensures that Python can locate the project modules correctly during testing.
